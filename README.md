* 6 R-scripts;
* README.md (this file);
* 6 PNG-files.

How the R-scripts work
----------------------
Each R script loads the relevant data, converts it as needed (e.g. enriching by calculations) and plots the results on screen plus saves it as PNG. 
I was not always entirely sure about the correct identification of the relevant data sets, and put according comments into the R scripts. However, 
I hope the results fulfill the requirements. For the various tasks, I tried different styles of the plotting tools. So design differs a bit across
scripting tasks. For the very last one, I did not quite figure out how to center bar labels for stacked bars. So I left the labels out. But
since that was not a required task, I consider that as not being of real relevance.


Please note the following: if you run the script as-is, your working directory will be used for the file operations. Can be changed if you e.g. change the 
working directory directly in the script.
